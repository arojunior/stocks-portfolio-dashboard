# Development History - Stock Portfolio Dashboard

## Project Overview
A comprehensive stock portfolio management dashboard built with Streamlit, replacing a Google Spreadsheet for tracking Brazilian and US stock investments.

## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Setup (Completed)
- âœ… Created virtual environment and project structure
- âœ… Set up basic Streamlit application
- âœ… Implemented portfolio management system with JSON storage
- âœ… Added multi-portfolio support (Brazilian & US markets)
- âœ… Basic stock data fetching using yfinance

### Phase 2: Data Sources & API Integration (Completed)
- âœ… Integrated multiple data sources (Yahoo Finance, Twelve Data, Alpha Vantage, BRAPI)
- âœ… Added API key support for premium data sources
- âœ… Implemented intelligent fallback system for data fetching
- âœ… Added rate limiting and caching to optimize API usage
- âœ… BRAPI integration for Brazilian stocks with API key support

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Completed)
- âœ… Technical analysis integration (inspired by DeepCharts project)
- âœ… Advanced charting with Plotly (candlestick charts, technical indicators)
- âœ… News feed integration (NewsAPI, Alpha Vantage News)
- âœ… AI-powered analysis (Ollama for local AI, Google Gemini for cloud AI)
- âœ… Portfolio analytics and performance metrics
- âœ… Configurable refresh intervals and manual refresh
- âœ… Progressive loading for large portfolios

### Phase 4: UI/UX Improvements (Completed)
- âœ… Responsive table design with dynamic height
- âœ… Color-coded performance indicators
- âœ… Error handling and fallback displays
- âœ… Loading indicators and progress bars
- âœ… Clean sidebar organization
- âœ… Support for fractional shares (US market)

### Phase 5: Current Issues & Incomplete Features

#### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. **Sector and Dividend Data Not Displaying**
   - Code changes made but not reflecting in UI
   - Streamlit caching issues preventing updates
   - Need to clear cache and force reload

2. **Streamlit Deprecation Warnings**
   - Multiple `use_container_width` warnings in logs
   - Need to update to `width="stretch"`

#### ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS:
1. **Sector Analysis Implementation**
   - Brazilian stock sector mapping partially implemented
   - Need to integrate with actual data fetching functions
   - US stock sector data requires yfinance integration

2. **Dividend Analysis Implementation**
   - Dividend yield and rate fetching logic exists
   - Annual dividend projections calculated
   - Not displaying in portfolio table

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **PortfolioManager**: JSON-based portfolio storage and management
- **Data Fetching Layer**: Multi-source API integration with fallbacks
- **Caching System**: Streamlit cache with TTL optimization
- **UI Layer**: Streamlit components with custom styling

### Data Sources
- **Yahoo Finance**: Primary fallback, free but rate-limited
- **BRAPI**: Brazilian stocks, free with API key support
- **Twelve Data**: Premium API for real-time data
- **Alpha Vantage**: Premium API for stocks and news
- **NewsAPI**: News feed integration

### AI Integration
- **Ollama**: Local AI for portfolio analysis (LLaMA models)
- **Google Gemini**: Cloud AI for news sentiment analysis

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### High Priority
1. **Sector/Dividend Data Display**: Code exists but not showing in UI
2. **Cache Management**: Streamlit cache not updating with code changes
3. **Deprecation Warnings**: Update `use_container_width` to `width`
4. **Indentation Issues**: Previous attempts created syntax errors

### Medium Priority
1. **Error Handling**: Improve user feedback for API failures
2. **Performance**: Optimize for large portfolios (>10 stocks)
3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Table display on smaller screens

### Low Priority
1. **Code Organization**: Split large file into modules
2. **Testing**: Add unit tests for core functions
3. **Documentation**: API documentation for functions

## Next Steps & TODOs

### Immediate (This Session)
- [ ] Fix sector and dividend data display issue
- [ ] Clear Streamlit cache completely
- [ ] Update README with current features
- [ ] Update SETUP with new API requirements
- [ ] Fix deprecation warnings

### Short Term (Next Sessions)
- [ ] Complete sector analysis feature
- [ ] Implement real dividend data fetching
- [ ] Add portfolio diversification metrics
- [ ] Improve error messages and user guidance

### Long Term (Future Development)
- [ ] Add portfolio comparison features
- [ ] Implement alerts and notifications
- [ ] Add export functionality (PDF reports)
- [ ] Mobile app version consideration

## Lessons Learned
1. **Indentation Management**: Python indentation is critical - use careful, minimal changes
2. **Streamlit Caching**: Cache can prevent code updates from showing - need manual clearing
3. **API Rate Limits**: Free tiers require careful optimization and fallback strategies
4. **User Feedback**: Always verify changes are visible to user, not just in code
