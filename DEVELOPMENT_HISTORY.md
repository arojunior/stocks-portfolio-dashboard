# Portfolio Dashboard Development History

## Project Overview
**Goal**: Create a comprehensive stock portfolio management dashboard to replace Google Spreadsheet tracking.

**Key Requirements**:
- Multi-portfolio support (Brazilian & US markets)
- Real-time stock price fetching
- Input: Ticker, Quantity, Average Price (same as spreadsheet)
- Auto-calculate all other metrics (gains/losses, portfolio value, etc.)
- Interactive visualizations and analytics

## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Requirements Analysis
**Date**: September 19, 2025

**Actions Completed**:
- âœ… Created new repository `stocks-portfolio-dashboard`
- âœ… Analyzed original requirements from `new-dashboard-specs.txt`
- âœ… Set up clean project structure
- âœ… Optimized `requirements.txt` for portfolio management focus

**Key Decisions**:
- Focus on real market data only (no mock/fake prices)
- Support multiple portfolios from day one
- Use Streamlit for rapid UI development
- JSON-based data persistence for simplicity

### Phase 2: Core Application Development
**Date**: September 19, 2025

**Actions Completed**:
- âœ… Built complete portfolio management system (`PortfolioManager` class)
- âœ… Implemented multi-source real-time data fetching
- âœ… Created comprehensive portfolio analytics engine
- âœ… Developed interactive Streamlit dashboard UI
- âœ… Added portfolio visualization charts (pie chart, bar chart)
- âœ… Implemented conditional formatting for gains/losses

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Data Sources**: Twelve Data API, Yahoo Finance with fallback
- **Storage**: JSON file (`portfolios.json`) for portfolio persistence
- **Caching**: 5-minute cache for API calls to prevent rate limiting
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when APIs fail

**Features Delivered**:
1. **Portfolio Management**:
   - Add/remove stocks with ticker, quantity, average price
   - Support for Brazilian (.SA suffix) and US stocks
   - Multiple portfolio creation and management

2. **Real-Time Analytics**:

   - Best/worst performer identification

3. **Interactive Dashboard**:
   - Portfolio composition pie chart
   - Performance overview bar chart
   - Detailed portfolio table with conditional formatting
   - Real-time metrics display

4. **User Experience**:
   - Sidebar-based portfolio and stock management
   - Auto-refresh option (30-second intervals)
   - Responsive design for desktop/mobile
   - Clear data source indicators

## Lessons Learned

### Challenges Faced
1. **API Rate Limiting**: Multiple stock APIs have strict rate limits
   - **Solution**: Implemented multi-source fallback system with caching

2. **Brazilian Stock Data**: Limited free APIs for B3 market
   - **Solution**: Yahoo Finance with .SA suffix handling

3. **Real vs Mock Data**: Initial temptation to use fake data for demo
   - **Solution**: Strict policy of real data only or clear "unavailable" messaging

### Best Practices Applied
- Clean separation of concerns (data, logic, UI)
- Comprehensive error handling
- User-friendly feedback messages
- Responsive design principles
- Efficient caching strategies
