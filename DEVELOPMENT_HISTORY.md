# Development History - Stock Portfolio Dashboard

## Project Overview

A comprehensive stock portfolio management dashboard built with Streamlit, replacing a Google Spreadsheet for tracking Brazilian and US stock investments.

## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Setup (Completed)

- âœ… Set up basic Streamlit application
- âœ… Implemented portfolio management system with JSON storage
- âœ… Added multi-portfolio support (Brazilian & US markets)
- âœ… Basic stock data fetching using yfinance

### Phase 2: Data Sources & API Integration (Completed)

### Phase 5: Live Data Implementation (Completed)

#### âœ… COMPLETED FEATURES:

1. **Live Dividend Data Implementation**

   - Enhanced dividend yield fetching from multiple APIs
   - Priority system: Live API data â†’ yfinance direct â†’ Static fallback
   - Support for both US and Brazilian stocks
   - Multiple dividend field detection across different APIs

2. **Enhanced API Integration**

   - yfinance: Direct dividend history calculation and stock.info extraction
   - Twelve Data: Enhanced field detection for dividend data
   - Alpha Vantage: Improved dividend field mapping
   - BRAPI: Brazilian stock dividend data integration

3. **Robust Fallback System**
   - Live data prioritized over static data
   - Graceful degradation when APIs are rate-limited
   - Static data maintained as reliable fallback for Brazilian stocks

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

- **PortfolioManager**: JSON-based portfolio storage and management
- **Data Fetching Layer**: Multi-source API integration with fallbacks
- **Caching System**: Streamlit cache with TTL optimization
- **UI Layer**: Streamlit components with custom styling

### Data Sources

- **Yahoo Finance**: Primary fallback, free but rate-limited
- **BRAPI**: Brazilian stocks, free with API key support
- **Twelve Data**: Premium API for real-time data
- **Alpha Vantage**: Premium API for stocks and news
- **NewsAPI**: News feed integration

### AI Integration

- **Ollama**: Local AI for portfolio analysis (LLaMA models)
- **Google Gemini**: Cloud AI for news sentiment analysis

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### High Priority

1. **Cache Management**: Streamlit cache not updating with code changes
2. **Deprecation Warnings**: Update `use_container_width` to `width`
3. **API Rate Limiting**: yfinance rate limiting affects live data fetching

### Medium Priority

1. **Error Handling**: Improve user feedback for API failures
2. **Performance**: Optimize for large portfolios (>10 stocks)
3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Table display on smaller screens
4. **Dividend Data Accuracy**: Some APIs don't provide dividend fields in basic endpoints

### Low Priority

1. **Code Organization**: Split large file into modules
2. **Testing**: Add unit tests for core functions
3. **Documentation**: API documentation for functions

## Next Steps & TODOs

### Immediate (This Session) - COMPLETED âœ…

- [x] Fix sector and dividend data display issue
- [x] Clear Streamlit cache completely
- [x] Update README with current features
- [x] Update SETUP with new API requirements
- [x] Fix deprecation warnings
- [x] Implement live dividend data fetching
- [x] Enhance API integrations for dividend data
- [x] Test live dividend functionality

### Short Term (Next Sessions) - COMPLETED âœ…

- [x] Complete sector analysis feature
- [x] Implement real dividend data fetching (using static mappings for Brazilian stocks)
- [x] Add portfolio diversification metrics
- [x] Improve error messages and user guidance
- [x] Implement multiple portfolio support
- [x] Fix annual dividend calculation to show total position dividends

### Long Term (Future Development)

- [ ] Add portfolio comparison features
- [ ] Implement alerts and notifications
- [ ] Add export functionality (PDF reports)
- [ ] Mobile app version consideration

## Major Completion Summary (January 2025)

### âœ… All TODOs Completed Successfully

- **Sector Analysis**: Comprehensive Brazilian stock sector mapping with live data integration
- **Dividend Analysis**: Total position dividend calculations with static yield mappings for reliability
- **Multiple Portfolio Support**: Full support for multiple portfolios per market with automatic migration
- **UI Enhancements**: Fixed deprecation warnings, improved error messages, added diversification metrics
- **Documentation**: Updated README.md and SETUP.md with all new features
- **Code Quality**: Added cursor rules, fixed all linting errors, proper git commits

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Features Delivered

1. **Real-time Sector Data**: Brazilian stocks now show proper sectors (Financial Services, Energy, Materials, etc.)
2. **Live Dividend Data**: Enhanced dividend yield fetching with priority system (Live API â†’ yfinance â†’ Static fallback)
3. **Total Dividend Income**: Annual dividend column shows total position income (yield Ã— current value)
4. **Portfolio Diversification**: Risk metrics, sector concentration, and diversification analysis
5. **Multiple Portfolios**: Support for different exchanges and markets in one dashboard
6. **Enhanced UX**: Better error handling, loading states, and user guidance
7. **Robust API Integration**: Multiple data sources with intelligent fallback system

## Lessons Learned

1. **Indentation Management**: Python indentation is critical - use careful, minimal changes
2. **Streamlit Caching**: Cache can prevent code updates from showing - need manual clearing
3. **API Rate Limits**: Free tiers require careful optimization and fallback strategies
4. **User Feedback**: Always verify changes are visible to user, not just in code
5. **Static Data Fallbacks**: For reliable data display, static mappings can be more reliable than rate-limited APIs
6. **Live Data Implementation**: Priority system (Live â†’ yfinance â†’ Static) provides best user experience
7. **API Field Detection**: Different APIs use different field names - comprehensive field mapping is essential
