## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git

### Setup with Virtual Environment (Recommended)
**Always use a virtual environment for Python projects!**

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd stocks-portfolio-dashboard

# 2. Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Upgrade pip and install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ðŸ“‹ **See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed installation instructions and troubleshooting.**

## Usage

### Running the Dashboard
```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is activated first!
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Then run the dashboard
streamlit run portfolio_dashboard.py
```

### Getting Started
1. **Create a Portfolio**: Use the sidebar to create a new portfolio (e.g., "Brazilian", "US", "Tech Stocks")
2. **Add Stocks**: Select your portfolio and use the "Add/Update Stock" section to add your holdings
   - For US stocks: Use ticker symbols like `AAPL`, `GOOGL`, `MSFT`
   - For Brazilian stocks: Use ticker symbols like `PETR4`, `VALE3`, `ITUB4`
3. **Monitor Performance**: The dashboard will automatically fetch real-time data and display your portfolio performance

### Stock Ticker Format
- **US Stocks**: Use the standard ticker symbol (e.g., `AAPL` for Apple)
- **Brazilian Stocks**: Use the ticker without the `.SA` suffix (e.g., `PETR4` for Petrobras) - the system will automatically add the `.SA` suffix when fetching data from Brazilian portfolios

## Data Sources

- **Stock Data**: Yahoo Finance (via `yfinance` library)
- **Real-Time Updates**: Prices are fetched in real-time when the dashboard loads
- **Market Support**: US stocks and Brazilian stocks (B3 exchange)
